/* Step 1: Plan */
/* Assuming that all values are available, dependent value already calculated from number of dependents */
Set state and federal tax rates
Initialize taxableWages, dependentWithholding, and postTaxAmount
Prompt for taxable wages and dependent withholdings
Create formula for state tax rate and federal tax rate applied to taxable wages
Calculate state tax amount, federal state amounts
Deduct taxes and dependent withholdings from taxable wages
Return the postTaxAmount

/* Step 3: Process */
    SET federalTaxAmount = (taxableWages * federalTaxRate)
    SET stateTaxAmount = (taxableWages * stateTaxRate)
