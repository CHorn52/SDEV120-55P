    // Step 1: Plan
        We need to get inputs from the user for the account balance
        Initialize account balance and number of overdraft variables
        Prompt for account balance and number of overdrafts
        Create formula for overdraft fee
        Calculate new account balance after subtracting overdraft fee
        Return the overdraft fee and the new account balance

    // Step 2: Input
        PRINT "What is the account balance?: "
        GET accountBalance

        PRINT "How many time has the account been overdrawn?: "
        GET numberOverdrafts

    // Step 3: Process
        SET overdraftFee = (accountBalance * 0.01) + (overDrafts * 5)
        SET accountBalance = (accountBalance - overdraftFee)

    // Step 4: Output
        PRINT "Overdraft fee for this account: ", overdraftFee
        PRINT "New account balance for this account: ", accountBalance
        PRINT "Thanks for using this program."
